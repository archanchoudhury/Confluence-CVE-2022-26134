## About
Over the Memorial Day weekend in the United States, Volexity conducted an incident response investigation involving two Internet-facing web servers belonging to one of its customers that were running Atlassian Confluence Server software. The investigation began after suspicious activity was detected on the hosts, which included JSP webshells being written to disk. Volexity immediately used Volexity Surge Collect Pro to collect system memory and key files from the Confluence Server systems for analysis. After a thorough review of the collected data, Volexity was able to determine the server compromise stemmed from an attacker launching an exploit to achieve remote code execution. Volexity was subsequently able to recreate that exploit and identify a zero-day vulnerability impacting fully up-to-date versions of Confluence Server.

Following the discovery and verification of this vulnerability, Volexity contacted Atlassian to report the relevant details on May 31, 2022. Atlassian has since confirmed the vulnerability and subsequently assigned the issue to CVE-2022-26134. It has been confirmed to work on current versions of Confluence Server and Data Center.

## Understanding-the-Exploit
 - You can refer the Volexity Blog [HERE](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2022/06/02/zero-day-exploitation-of-atlassian-confluence/) to understand the full deatils of working principle of this explit and the details of analysis
 - Watch this [VIDEO]() for understanding the exploit and it's remediation.

## List-of-IOCs
- Since this is a zero day vulnerability, and can be exploited very easily, there is no exclusive list of IOCs. From the community research it was observed attacker tried to deploy XMRIG, KINSING, MIRAI etc after exploitation.
- Exploit string “appears” to contain this string **${** This pattern isn’t urlencoded and isn’t URL SAFE so it would appear as: $%7B in the logs.
- The veloxity blog references the confluence file: **noop.jsp**
- A presence of a webshell as .jsp extention with no path details. For example [THIS](https://github.com/tennc/webshell/blob/master/caidao-shell/%E8%8F%9C%E5%88%80jsp%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9.jsp)

## Detection-Strategy
- If you have an internet facing Confluence Server and Data Center which is unpacthed, it is wise to interprit as **Compromised**
- Look for NEW files in the confluence path on disk which is having .jsp extention or any other.
- Look for suspicious child processes from tomcat logs

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName has_any( @"tomcat9.exe")
//| where ProcessCommandLine has_any (@"whoami.exe",@"nslookup.exe")
```
- Look for string ```${``` in ```(install directory)/logs/*.log```
- In access logs try ```egrep -a -i -f pattern.txt *.log ``` where pattern.txt should be saved as ```${``` or just try ```grep "\${" log file path```
- You might have web request coming in for noop.js, so you  can try ```findstr -i noop.jsp "logpath"```
- You may have different install directories, so try to find ```$jspname_jsp.java``` in ```confluence_install_dir/work/Standalone/``` directory. For example, if you find a shell name ```hack.jsp``` you should see ```hack_jsp.java``` If you don't find ```hack.jsp``` in no longer in disk, try to pivot in web logs to look for access to it. It will give the signifance when it was accessed/deleted.
